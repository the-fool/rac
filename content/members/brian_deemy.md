Brian Deemy is a photographer specializing in alternative and experimental processes.

*"What initially drew me to photography as a chosen medium was its inherent dichotomy. There are always two forces at play in a photographic image, the subject matter and the physical image. I tend to think of it in terms of right brain versus left brain; on one side the abstract the ephemeral, on the other the mechanical the mathematic. Creating a conversation between these polar ends is what I strive to do in my imagery."*
